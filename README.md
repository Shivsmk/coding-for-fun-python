# coding-for-fun-python
I started this project to share the various python projects I wanted to learn and code in python. There are no particular theme to this github project - what ever pops into my mind and I feel like I need to code it, goes here.
Feel free to have a look and suggest any improvements in coding style or performance improvement. I would greatly appreciate the feedback and constructive criticism.
